                <h2>Hello! I am<image src="Paul-designstyle-america-m.png"></image><br> Welcome to my portfolio webpage</br></h2>
                <p>I am 21 years of age and am currently a student at Zetech University studying for my IT degree.
                I studied at a primary school called Naramat Academy and then Went on to Moi forces academy. I aspire to be a network Engineer with a bit of skill in cybersecurity. I would not say that am the most passionate person when it comes to IT but the challenges and dynamics of the industry is what made me develop an interest for it. 
                The adaptation of technology by the world in everyday life inspires me to gain more knowledge in the field of IT since everybody will be pushing for people to be tech proficient in the future.</p>
